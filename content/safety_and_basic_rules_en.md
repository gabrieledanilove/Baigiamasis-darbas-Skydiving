Skydiving safety relies on standardized procedures, qualified instructors, appropriate equipment (including a reserve parachute and AAD) and respecting weather and wind limits.
Students are trained to maintain altitude awareness, follow emergency procedures for canopy malfunctions, and never jump when tired, impaired or outside the club’s equipment and clothing rules.
