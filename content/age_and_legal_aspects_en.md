Operators in Lithuania usually set a minimum age of around 14 years for training and tandem jumps, but in that case written consent from parents or legal guardians is required. From the age of 18, a person is considered responsible for themselves and can sign all documents and assume full responsibility without parental consent.
All jumpers must sign documents that describe responsibilities, risks, and the conditions under which the jump will take place.
