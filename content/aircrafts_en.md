Common skydiving aircraft include small single‑engine planes like the Cessna 182, which carry four or five jumpers at a time. In addition, some Lithuanian dropzones also use larger Antonov AN‑2 aircraft, which can take more skydivers per load and are popular for group jumps.
Busier dropzones may use larger aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, King Air, Skyvan or similar planes, which can carry bigger groups and climb efficiently to typical jump altitudes.
