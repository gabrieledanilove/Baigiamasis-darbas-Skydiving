To become a skydiver, a person usually starts with a tandem jump or a student training jump to see if the activity is suitable.
The next step is to join a structured student program, normally an AFF course, after which the person can jump more independently and build experience toward a license.
A motivated student can often complete the basic course within a few days or weekends, depending on weather, aircraft availability and personal progress.
Reaching the first full license level usually takes several months and a few dozen jumps, because the student must gain consistency, confidence and the required skill set.
Before a first jump, it is important to be rested, have eaten normally, and wear comfortable sports clothing and suitable shoes; the operator usually provides the technical gear.
New jumpers should be prepared for possible delays due to weather and are encouraged to ask instructors about every step of the process until they feel confident.
